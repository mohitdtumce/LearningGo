		It essentially means that even though it spawns another goroutine inside the main() function, it will not provide any CPU to newly spawned goroutine and it is still executing main() function.
		So instead of printing "Hello Again", it is printing "Goodnight". This is called race-condition and something which we want to avoid.

		1. Don't create goroutines in libraries. Let consumer control concurrency.
